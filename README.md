For the third objective, outline the basic flow/objectives of the unit. Something like: "by the end of this unit you will know how to create SQLite3 databases, create database tables, insert data into, update the data within, select and delete data from those database tables. You will learn how data within a given database can be related and how to write Ruby programs that talk to your databases and actually save data into them."
